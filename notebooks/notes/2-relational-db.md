# Relational Databases

Data is a series of tuples (fields). We can define relationships between these tuples.

  - **Primary key**: Is a unique identifier for a tuple. Each **table** in a relational database **must** have only one tuple with that primary key value.
  - **Foreign key**: indicates a relationship between the given tuple and another tuple that is a **primary key** in another database.
