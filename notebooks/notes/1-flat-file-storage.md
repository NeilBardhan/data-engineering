# Flat File Storage

Softwares usually have a short-term memory. Data is usually stored as variables that are lost when that software is terminated. 

Often, it is useful to store data in longer term memory such as the hard drive. This can help programs interact with more data than can be held in memory at any one time.

Flat file storage is a generic term for text-based files that typically can be read by a person. There are many different formats. Some common ones are

  - CSV
  - JSON
  - XML
